## 🛠️ Team Setup & Git Workflow (READ THIS FIRST)
Every team member must follow these steps to avoid breaking the repository or losing data.

### 1. Install & Activate Git LFS
We use **Large File Storage (LFS)** for our videos. 
1. Download/Install: [https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
2. Inside the project folder, run: `git lfs install`

### 2. Standard Daily Workflow
Always sync before you start:
* **Pull latest:** `git pull origin main`
* **Create a Branch:** NEVER code on `main`. Create your own: 
  `git checkout -b feature/your-name-task`
* **Save Changes:** `git add .`
  `git commit -m "STG-X: brief description"`
  `git push origin feature/your-name-task`

### 3. Jira Integration
To link your work to our Scrum board, you **must** include the Jira Ticket ID at the start of every commit (e.g., `STG-5: added DCT matrix`).
